We have it. The project is all about getting feedback on conferences: a list of conferences on the homepage, a page for each conference, full of nice comments. A comment is composed of some small text and an optional photo taken during the conference. I suppose I have just written down all the specifications we need to get started.

The project will contain several applications. A traditional web application with an HTML frontend, an API, and an SPA for mobile phones.
